### Bio

I am a PhD candidate in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Tennessee Knoxville. I study eco-evolutionary dynamics using a broad range of theorhetical frameworks, open source data, and phylogenetics. I create software tools (e.g. R and Python packages) to bridge science, computation, visualization, and application with a special focus on species rarity and biodiversity.

### Interests

There is currently a large divide between data collection, analysis, visualization, and application, especially as it relates to eco-evolutionary theory. I am interested in bridging this divide through the creation of software tools that make new data more accessable, reanalyse old data using new theory, and visualize these data across space and time. I'm excited by new developments in phylogenetics, models of trait evolution, ecological niche models, and machine learning as it can be applied to natural systems.
